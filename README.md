# AI Projects Repository

This repository contains four distinct projects focused on different aspects of artificial intelligence:

1. **Neural Networks**
2. **Search Problems Using Heuristics**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Ontologies**

## Project 1: Neural Networks
This project explores the creation and training of neural networks for various tasks, such as classification and regression.

### Features
- Build neural networks using sklearn.
- Train and evaluate models on different datasets.
- Experiment with different hyperparameters and regularization techniques.
- Analyze performance according to the dimensionality of the data

## Project 2: Search Problems Using Heuristics
This project focuses on solving search problems using heuristic methods, which guide the search process towards more promising solutions.

### Features
- Implement A* and other heuristic search algorithms.
- Apply heuristic search to pathfinding and puzzle-solving.
- Analyze performance and efficiency of different heuristics.
- Implement heuristics that minimize node expansion

## Project 3: Decision Trees
This project demonstrates the implementation and application of decision trees, a type of supervised learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

### Features
- Build decision trees using sklearn.
- Pruning techniques to optimize tree performance.
- Analyze performance according to the dimensionality of the data
- Testing the limits of decision trees

## Project 4: Ontologies
This project involves creating and managing ontologies, which are formal representations of knowledge as a set of concepts within a domain, and the relationships between those concepts.

### Features
- Define and structure knowledge domains.
- Utilize ontology development tools like Protégé.
- Example use cases in semantic web and information retrieval.
